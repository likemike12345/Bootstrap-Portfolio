# Bootstrap-Portfolio
A simple portfolio made using bootstrap5 to quicken the process

## Description

This is simply a portfolio made to display/describe some the works I have comleted since starting the Edx bootcamp in front end web development. It differs to the previous potfolio as this one required that bootstrap was used to make certain aspects of it; particularly the work section of the portfolio 


## Installation

In order to complete this project I installed

*bootstrap- For snippets of code that made up sections of the portfolio.

*"line awesome"- A website containing libraries of icons which I was able to gather a few to use in my portfolio. These can be seen in the projects section.

*"aos master"- Which provided me with libraries containing code for the transitions seen in my portfolio. The transitions can be identified in the index.html in elements with "aos-" as a precursor to what the transition may be.

## Usage

This portfolio was made as a way for future employers to see the kind of projects I've worked on as a developer. As I add more complex/job relevant projects hopefully increase my chances of employability as a web designer
